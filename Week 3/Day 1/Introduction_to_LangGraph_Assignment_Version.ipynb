        "Beyond the agent-forward approach - we can easily compose and combine traditional \"DAG\" (directed acyclic graph) chains with powerful cyclic behaviour due to the tight integration with LCEL. This means it's a natural extension to LangChain's core offerings!"

QLoRA backpropagates gradients through\\na frozen, 4-bit quantized pretrained language model into Low Rank\\nAdapters~(LoRA). Our best model family, which we name Guanaco, outperforms all\\nprevious openly released models on the Vicuna benchmark, reaching 99.3% of the\\nperformance level of ChatGPT while only requiring 24 hours of finetuning on a\\nsingle GPU. QLoRA introduces a number of innovations to save memory without\\nsacrificing performance: (a) 4-bit NormalFloat (NF4), a new data type that is\\ninformation theoretically optimal for normally distributed weights (b) double\\nquantization to reduce the average memory footprint by quantizing the\\nquantization constants, and (c) paged optimziers to manage memory spikes. We\\nuse QLoRA to finetune more than 1,000 models, providing a detailed analysis of\\ninstruction following and chatbot performance across 8 instruction datasets,\\nmultiple model types (LLaMA, T5), and model scales that would be infeasible to\\nrun with regular finetuning (e.g. 33B and 65B parameter models). Our results\\nshow that QLoRA finetuning on a small high-quality dataset leads to\\nstate-of-the-art results, even when using smaller models than the previous\\nSoTA. We provide a detailed analysis of chatbot performance based on both human\\nand GPT-4 evaluations showing that GPT-4 evaluations are a cheap and reasonable\\nalternative to human evaluation. Furthermore, we find that current chatbot\\nbenchmarks are not trustworthy to accurately evaluate the performance levels of\\nchatbots. A lemon-picked analysis demonstrates where Guanaco fails compared to\\nChatGPT.

However, existing methods cause the quantized LLM to severely degrade\\nand even fail to benefit from the finetuning of LoRA. This paper proposes a\\nnovel IR-QLoRA for pushing quantized LLMs with LoRA to be highly accurate\\nthrough information retention. The proposed IR-QLoRA mainly relies on two\\ntechnologies derived from the perspective of unified information: (1)\\nstatistics-based Information Calibration Quantization allows the quantized\\nparameters of LLM to retain original information accurately; (2)\\nfinetuning-based Information Elastic Connection makes LoRA utilizes elastic\\nrepresentation transformation with diverse information. Comprehensive\\nexperiments show that IR-QLoRA can significantly improve accuracy across LLaMA\\nand LLaMA2 families under 2-4 bit-widths, e.g., 4- bit LLaMA-7B achieves 1.4%\\nimprovement on MMLU compared with the state-of-the-art methods. The significant\\nperformance gain requires only a tiny 0.31% additional time consumption,\\nrevealing the satisfactory efficiency of our IR-QLoRA. We highlight that\\nIR-QLoRA enjoys excellent versatility, compatible with various frameworks\\n(e.g., NormalFloat and Integer quantization) and brings general accuracy gains.\\nThe code is available at https://github.com/htqin/ir-qlora.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-06-12\\nTitle: Exploring Fact Memorization and Style Imitation in LLMs Using QLoRA: An Experimental Study and Quality Assessment Methods\\nAuthors: Eugene Vyborov, Oleksiy Osypenko, Serge Sotnyk\\nSummary: There are various methods for adapting LLMs to different domains.

              "\"RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation. It is a technique used in natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning to improve the performance of language models by combining retrieval-based methods with generative models. Here's a brief overview of how it works:\\n\\n1. **Retrieval**: In the first step, the system retrieves relevant documents or pieces of information from a large corpus or database. This is typically done using a retrieval model, such as BM25 or a dense retrieval model like DPR (Dense Passage Retrieval).\\n\\n2. **Augmentation**: The retrieved documents are then used to augment the input to the generative model. This means that the generative model has access to additional context or information that can help it produce more accurate and relevant responses.\\n\\n3. **Generation**: Finally, the generative model, such as GPT-3 or BERT, uses the augmented input to generate a response. The additional context provided by the retrieved documents helps the model generate more informed and contextually appropriate responses.\\n\\nRAG is particularly useful in scenarios where the generative model alone might not have enough information to produce a high-quality response, such as in open-domain question answering or conversational AI. By leveraging external knowledge sources through retrieval, RAG can significantly enhance the performance and accuracy of language models.\""

Here are some significant improvements and benefits that the LoRA system offers:\\n\\n1. **Parameter Efficiency**: LoRA allows for fine-tuning of large models with a significantly smaller number of parameters. This is achieved by introducing low-rank matrices that adapt the pre-trained model weights, reducing the number of parameters that need to be updated during fine-tuning.\\n\\n2. **Reduced Computational Cost**: By reducing the number of parameters that need to be updated, LoRA decreases the computational resources required for fine-tuning. This makes it more feasible to fine-tune large models on smaller hardware setups.\\n\\n3. **Memory Efficiency**: LoRA's approach of using low-rank matrices means that less memory is required to store the fine-tuned model. This is particularly beneficial when deploying models on devices with limited memory capacity.\\n\\n4. **Faster Training**: The reduction in the number of parameters and computational cost leads to faster training times. This allows for quicker iterations and experimentation during the model development process.\\n\\n5. **Maintaining Performance**: Despite the reduction in parameters, LoRA has been shown to maintain or even improve the performance of the fine-tuned models. This is because the low-rank adaptation effectively captures the necessary adjustments without the need for a full parameter update.\\n\\n6. **Scalability**: LoRA can be applied to various types of neural networks and is not limited to a specific architecture. This makes it a versatile tool for fine-tuning different kinds of models across various tasks.\\n\\n7. **Flexibility**: LoRA can be combined with other fine-tuning techniques, providing additional flexibility in how models are adapted to new tasks or datasets.\\n\\nIf you are looking for more detailed and specific improvements or recent advancements related to LoRA, I can search for the latest research papers or articles.

Here are some key advantages:\\n\\n1. **Spatial Hierarchy of Features**:\\n   - CNNs are designed to recognize patterns with a hierarchical structure, starting from low-level features (like edges and textures) to high-level features (like shapes and objects). This makes them particularly effective for image and video data.\\n\\n2. **Parameter Sharing**:\\n   - Convolutional layers use the same filter (or kernel) across different parts of the input, which significantly reduces the number of parameters compared to fully connected networks. This parameter sharing helps in learning spatial hierarchies and reduces the risk of overfitting.\\n\\n3. **Translation Invariance**:\\n   - CNNs are inherently translation invariant, meaning they can recognize objects regardless of their position in the image. This is due to the nature of convolution operations and pooling layers.\\n\\n4. **Local Connectivity**:\\n   - Each neuron in a convolutional layer is connected only to a local region of the input, which makes the network more efficient and reduces the number of parameters. This local connectivity also helps in capturing local patterns effectively.\\n\\n5. **Effective Use of Data**:\\n   - CNNs can effectively use large amounts of labeled data to learn complex patterns. They are particularly good at leveraging data augmentation techniques to improve generalization.\\n\\n6. **Automatic Feature Extraction**:\\n   - Unlike traditional machine learning methods that require manual feature extraction, CNNs automatically learn the best features directly from the data. This reduces the need for domain-specific knowledge and feature engineering.\\n\\n7. **Robustness to Variations**:\\n   - CNNs are robust to variations in the input data, such as changes in lighting, scale, and rotation. This robustness is achieved through the use of convolutional and pooling layers.\\n\\n8. **Efficiency in Computation**:\\n   - Due to their architecture, CNNs are highly efficient in terms of computation. They can be easily parallelized and are well-suited for implementation on GPUs, which significantly speeds up the training process.\\n\\n9. **Versatility**:\\n   - While CNNs are most commonly used for image-related tasks, they have also been successfully applied to other types of data, such as audio, text, and time series, demonstrating their versatility.\\n\\n10. **State-of-the-Art Performance**:\\n    - CNNs have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various tasks, including image classification, object detection, and segmentation, making them a go-to choice for many computer vision applications.\\n\\nThese advantages make CNNs a powerful and popular choice for a wide range of applications in machine learning and artificial intelligence.',\n",

The model tries to learn the underlying structure of the data.\\n2. **Data**: Uses unlabeled data, where the model tries to identify patterns and relationships within the data.\\n3. **Objective**: The goal is to find hidden patterns or intrinsic structures in the input data.\\n4. **Algorithms**: Common algorithms include K-Means Clustering, Hierarchical Clustering, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Association Rules.\\n5. **Applications**: Used in applications like clustering (e.g., customer segmentation, grouping similar items), dimensionality reduction (e.g., reducing the number of features in a dataset), and anomaly detection (e.g., fraud detection).\\n\\n### Summary\\n- **Supervised Learning**: Uses labeled data to predict outcomes for new data.\\n- **Unsupervised Learning**: Uses unlabeled data to find hidden patterns or intrinsic structures.\\n\\nBoth types of learning have their own strengths and are used based on the nature of the problem and the availability of labeled data.',\n",

This paradigm presents challenges for\\nsystems that serve real-time responses to queries that each involve a different\\nLoRA. Prior works optimize the design of such systems but still require\\ncontinuous loading and offloading of LoRAs, as it is infeasible to store\\nthousands of LoRAs in GPU memory. To mitigate this issue, we investigate the\\nefficacy of compression when serving LoRA adapters. We consider compressing\\nadapters individually via SVD and propose a method for joint compression of\\nLoRAs into a shared basis paired with LoRA-specific scaling matrices. Our\\nexperiments with up to 500 LoRAs demonstrate that compressed LoRAs preserve\\nperformance while offering major throughput gains in realistic serving\\nscenarios with over a thousand LoRAs, maintaining 75% of the throughput of\\nserving a single LoRA.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-04-07\\nTitle: A Note on LoRA\\nAuthors: Vlad Fomenko, Han Yu, Jongho Lee, Stanley Hsieh, Weizhu Chen\\nSummary: LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) has emerged as a preferred method for efficiently\\nadapting Large Language Models (LLMs) with remarkable simplicity and efficacy.\\nThis note extends the original LoRA paper by offering new perspectives that\\nwere not initially discussed and presents a series of insights for deploying\\nLoRA at scale.

In fact, the output of LoRA (product of LoRA parameter and hidden\\nstate), directly impacts the final results.

However, their general ability to improve\\nthe performance of physiological signal deep learning model is immature. In\\nthis study, we experimentally analyze four attention mechanisms (e.g.,\\nsqueeze-and-excitation, non-local, convolutional block attention module, and\\nmulti-head self-attention) and three convolutional neural network (CNN)\\narchitectures (e.g., VGG, ResNet, and Inception) for two representative\\nphysiological signal prediction tasks: the classification for predicting\\nhypotension and the regression for predicting cardiac output (CO). We evaluated\\nmultiple combinations for performance and convergence of physiological signal\\ndeep learning model. Accordingly, the CNN models with the spatial attention\\nmechanism showed the best performance in the classification problem, whereas\\nthe channel attention mechanism achieved the lowest error in the regression\\nproblem. Moreover, the performance and convergence of the CNN models with\\nattention mechanisms were better than stand-alone self-attention models in both\\nproblems. Hence, we verified that convolutional operation and attention\\nmechanisms are complementary and provide faster convergence time, despite the\\nstand-alone self-attention models requiring fewer parameters.\\n\\nPublished: 2018-10-17\\nTitle: An Analysis of Attention Mechanisms: The Case of Word Sense Disambiguation in Neural Machine Translation\\nAuthors: Gongbo Tang, Rico Sennrich, Joakim Nivre\\nSummary: Recent work has shown that the encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in neural\\nmachine translation (NMT) are different from the word alignment in statistical\\nmachine translation. In this paper, we focus on analyzing encoder-decoder\\nattention mechanisms, in the case of word sense disambiguation (WSD) in NMT\\nmodels. We hypothesize that attention mechanisms pay more attention to context\\ntokens when translating ambiguous words. We explore the attention distribution\\npatterns when translating ambiguous nouns. Counter-intuitively, we find that\\nattention mechanisms are likely to distribute more attention to the ambiguous\\nnoun itself rather than context tokens, in comparison to other nouns. We\\nconclude that attention mechanism is not the main mechanism used by NMT models\\nto incorporate contextual information for WSD. The experimental results suggest\\nthat NMT models learn to encode contextual information necessary for WSD in the\\nencoder hidden states. For the attention mechanism in Transformer models, we\\nreveal that the first few layers gradually learn to \"align\" source and target\\ntokens and the last few layers learn to extract features from the related but\\nunaligned context tokens.', name='arxiv', tool_call_id='call_noieJS7YctnDSyasWx5zVvCC')]\n",
